subject  re  centris 610 clock adjustment 

the article was probably referring to changing the clock oscillator in a manner similar to that done on quadra 700 s and iisi s  i haven t read a report of this actually being done on a centris 610 but supposedly this also works on q900 
q950 and centris 650 machines
