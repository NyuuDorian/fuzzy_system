 i know of several nubus frame grabber boards but wonder if there
 might be similar ones for the lesser macs  those without slots  
 something permitting instant freezing of a video picture  pal  
 and feeding it in without jaggies to a simple digitizer like 
 macvision  which takes 22 secs to scan a picture  so a frame
 grabber is a necessity   

 the objective is 512 342 1bit  pixel  b w  pictures stored in
 hypercard    have tried using top quality vcr with freeze frame
 function but the screens come out full of streaks and garbage 

    please reply only to             ianf random se
      and i ll summarize
      to the net  cannot
   read such high volume
    group as is c s m h              thanks
