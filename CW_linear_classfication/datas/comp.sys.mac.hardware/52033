my school is settinã¿ã»g up a new network with bothe macs and apple ii s   i m
used to ethernet  and don t know muã¿ch about localtalk   two things   first 
in macwherehouse  btheã¿y have poweruser network connectors  and the caption
leads you to belã¿ã»ieve that you can plug them into the phone lines in the
building and have them work   is this true   i ve seen it done by running
sepã¿erate phone cords  but never with real lines   second  if that does work 
could you use a modem ã¿hooked up to that same line while the network was
active   help would be greatly appriciated   btw ã¿ârunning seperate phone line 
is out of the question  the network wil  verry spread o
