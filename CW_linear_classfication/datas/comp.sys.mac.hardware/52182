subject  centris 610 clock adjustment 

i was reading a review of the centris 610 in this 
months macworld and the reviewer said that for 
$4 you could make an adjustment on the clock speed
of the chip and change it from 20mhz to 25mhz   i 
haven t heard of this before  and i don t think that
this is the 040 chip replacement  with fpu  that i have
seen so much talk about   anyone have any ideas
