subject  re  desktop rebuild and datadesk keyboard 


my datadesk mac 101e keyboard has similar problems  i have found that
holding down the right hand shift key at startup will work  disable
extensions   but the left hand shift key won t  which is unfortunate  since
the left one is the one i instinctively reach for  

similarly  i have trained myself to hold down the right hand pair of
command option for desktop rebuilds 

i  is  irritating 

cheers 
michael
