subject  hard disk error

hi there 

when i run disk first aid on my external hard drive  quantum lps 240  i get the followinf
message  error  535  missing thread record  tarid 31015  tarblock 416 
disk first aid is not able to fix this problem  norton utils doesn t find it at all 
when i use norton disk editor to look at tarblock 416 i can read something like  dirreservedarea 

my question  how can i get rid of this error  without reformatting of course
