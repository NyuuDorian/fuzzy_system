    no  buy the serial port and modem  each can be used for other things 
  you can use the modem with your next computer  might not be a pc  or
  upgrade the modem without changing the box  i hear that isdn is big in
  europe  you might be able to get one of those beautiful isdn modems for
  less than the pice of a car someday  64k bidirectional
