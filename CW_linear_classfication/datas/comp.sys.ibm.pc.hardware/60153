    No  buy the serial port and modem  Each can be used for other things 
  you can use the modem with your next computer  might not be a PC  or
  upgrade the modem without changing the box  I hear that ISDN is big in
  Europe  you might be able to get one of those beautiful ISDN modems for
  less than the pice of a car someday  64k bidirectional
