 	winjet is not a video card    it s  printer  accelerator manufactured
 	by lasermaster  eden prairie  mn  

i know there s a winjet for the laserjet and there s also a winjet accelerator
video card  this is probably not available in the us  but i am sure it is
being marketed in canada  i thought you guys over there would have heard some 
thing about it
