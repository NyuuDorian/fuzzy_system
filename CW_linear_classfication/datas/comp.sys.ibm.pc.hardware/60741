subject  what do you know about cornell systems 

the subject says it all  i m wondering if anyone on the net has
had any experiences with cornell computer systems of california 
i was checking out their ad in computer shopper  and they seem to
have a good balance between service  price  and hardware  the question
is    are they reliable 

e mail responses would be appreciated 

thanks
