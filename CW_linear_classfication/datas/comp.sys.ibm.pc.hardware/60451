from  ggg kepler unh edu  gregory g greene 
subject  re  ide vs scsi

  first off  with all these huge software packages and files that
  they produce  ide may no longer be sufficient for me  510 mb limit  

	micropolis seems to have broken this limit   they have ide 560meg
   and 1050meg hd s available
