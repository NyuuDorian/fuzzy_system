subject  re  trident 8800cs drivers for win 3 1

  you can find the drivers at wuarchive wustl edu in the  msdos windows3 sub 
  directory   i think the files are called  tvgawin31a zip  and  tvgawin31b zip  
  those are the latest drivers available as far as i know 

i downloaded these files a couple of days ago and they appeared to be
incompatible with this particular card  none of the svga drivers worked 
they re probably for the newer 8900 and 9000 series
