subject  help choosing scsi controler


i need to buy a scsi controler for my 486 machine to use with a quantum  
425f harddrive  i know that adaptec is good  but they are kind of  
expensive  essentially i want a controller in the $100 $150 range that i
can use with this drive  i plan to use windows and later on os 2 1 when it  
comes out  any reccomendations appreciated
